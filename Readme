***********     BROWSER DRIVER SETUP   ******************
Before running any test in robot via Frontend, it's necessary to set all drivers binary into Environment Variable.
The best way to do that is to gather all driver into one folder and map that folder into Environment Variable, inside PATH
With that folder configured inside PATH, robot will search for the drivers in all directories inside PATH 

Downloads:
Chromedriver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
Geckodriver:  https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
Edgedriver:   https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/     

Driver name should be:
Chrome      ->      chromedriver.exe
Firefox     ->      geckodriver.exe
Edge        ->      MicrosoftWebDriver.exe

Note: Always make sure that your current browser version is the same as the driver you're downloading

************   PYTHON VERSION    ******************
For Windows
Python Version -> Python 3.9.4

For MacOS
Python Version -> Python 3.9.4

*********    COMMAND LINE    **********
robot -d ./logs -i tagName -v NAME:VALUE folder\directory or folder\directory\fileName.robot

-d ./path/to/logs       ->   Means that it'll be created the robot test report into logs folder. Usually it's always the same directory
-i tagName              ->   Means that it'll run just the scenarios with that tag. For multiple tag, use AND. (e.g. -> tagNameANDanothertagName) 
-v NAME:VALUE           ->   Means that it'll set a global variable into the test.
-R path/to/output.xml   ->   Means that it'll run all failed scenarios from output.xml file  

For variables, always use the ENVIRONMENT and BROWSER (for Frontend tests). if you don't send those variables, the code won't
know which browser to use or which environment to run the test.

e.g. -> -v ENVIRONMENT:dev -v BROWSER:chrome    ->   Run test in chrome and DEV environment
e.g. -> -v ENVIRONMENT:stg -v BROWSER:firefox   ->   Run test in firefox and STG environment

For ENVIRONMENT, there is:
- DEV
- STG

For BROWSER there is:
- chrome
- firefox
- edge

*********    PROFILES    **********
To run your regressive tests, use profiles regressive.cmd file. 
To run this file, you'll need 4 variables.

                                                      1º     2º     3º       4º
e. g.  ->     ./resources/profiles/regressive.cmd doneANDSTG stg  chrome tests\publisher

1º -> Tags: Remember that the command it's in robot, so if your tests need more than one tag, use "AND" to 
            separate then. (e. g. FirstTagANDSecondTag)
2º -> Environment: Send the desired environment to run your tests.
3º -> Browser: Send the desired browser to run your tests.
4º -> Path to your tests: Send a file or a path to run your tests inside that path.

IMPORTANT: All those parameters should be separated by a single space.
